I'm a programmer and tinkerer. After living in Belgium, Scotland and Canada, I've settled in Brazil. 

I got my start in web programming before moving mainly to mobile apps and cloud solutions, coinciding with the rise of mobile and the cloud, most notably iOS and AWS. I think of myself as a generalist.

Besides coding, I'm trying to master Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and running a 5K in under 20 mins.
